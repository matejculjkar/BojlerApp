# BojlerApp
## This app is used to turn on or off a water heater remotely via SMS which is sent to ARDUINO UNO with SIM and Relay module. The app has also a possibility to run certain programs of heating, for example to heat water only for certain amount of time, or to only heat the water during cheaper electricity. You can use it on multiple devices, because all work is synhronized. App also picks up the weather data to make heating times shorter or longer regarding the outside temperature.
